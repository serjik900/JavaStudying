//Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and color and method calculateSalePrice()
// which should be returning a price of the car.
//Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice() method
//in which returned price is calculated as following: if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, otherwise 20% discount.
//The Sedan class has field as length and also does its own implementation of calculateSalePrice():
// if length of sedan is >20 feet then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
